Relational Model
	Data Collections
		Set -  no order, and unique aka no duplicates
			Ex: {1, 3, 2}
		List - ordered set - can have duplicates
			Ex: {1,1, 2, 3)
		Bag - AKA Multiset - unordered but has duplicates
			Ex: {1,1, 2, 3, 1}
	Attribute (Column):
		ATOMIC Value (Unbreakable)
			Don't care about structure of data cause we get stream of bytes
			at the higher level
	Tuple (Rows)
		a LIST of attribute values
	Relation (Table):
